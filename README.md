- Data structures (lists, dicts, sets, tuples)
- Modules & packages
- Beginner notes & examples

### 2️⃣ Practice
- Coding exercises
- Mini projects (e.g. calculators, file parsers)
- Jupyter notebooks
- Reinforce concepts with hands-on coding

### 3️⃣ Expert
- Data analysis (NumPy, Pandas)
- Visualisation (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Machine learning (Scikit-learn, basic ML models)
- Real projects with datasets
